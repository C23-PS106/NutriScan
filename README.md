## about NutriScan

In current society, people eat various foods daily, yet they ignore their daily needs for nutrients and just eat what they want. Many people find it too troublesome to check the nutrients contained in their food because it is somewhat difficult to get information about their food nutrients. This habit may lead to malnutrition, diabetes, cholesterol, etc. Therefore, we came up with an idea to facilitate people to get information about nutrients contained in food by building a mobile app that can help people precisely recognize what nutrients are contained in their daily consumed foods.  

Just take a photo of your meal using our application, then we will learn what food you eat and what nutrients it contains.
